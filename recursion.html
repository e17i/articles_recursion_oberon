<h1 class="title">Transforming recursive Algorithms into iterative loops (in Oberon)</h1>

<h2 id="org6134725">TL;DR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6134725">
<p>
Some years ago, I was trying to wrap my head around how to transform
recursions into iterative loops. The way to go would be transforming
typical recursions (e.g. derived from mathematical definitions) into
tail-call recursions, which can then easily be expressed as loops. The
harder part (especially when more than one recursion call is involved) is
the transformation into a tail call recursion, which can be done using
continuation passing. Motivation was, besides avoiding stack
overflows, to gain a better understanding of the properties of
recursive algorithms. I was doing this using <code>Oberon</code> (With's object
oriented successor to <code>Pascal</code>), which I think until today is one of
the languages most suitable for expressing readable algorithms.
Besides that, it seems still worthy to learn from these experiments
when e.g. programming in python.

<div id="outline-container-org25a5394" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org25a5394">The fibonacci sequence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org25a5394">
<p>
The fibonacci sequence is a classical example of a sequence defined in
terms of recursion. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>f<sub>1</sub> = f<sub>2</sub> = 1</li>
<li>f<sub>n</sub> = f<sub>n-2</sub> + f<sub>n-1</sub></li>
</ol>

<p>
It also can be expressed easily in an iterative
way:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>(f<sub>a</sub>, f<sub>b</sub>) := (1, 1)</li>
<li>(f<sub>a</sub>, f<sub>b</sub>) := (f<sub>b</sub>, f<sub>a</sub> + f<sub>b</sub>)</li>
<li>repeat step 2 until requested number reached</li>
</ol>

<p>
While this can be formulated as a simple tail call recursion quite
nicely, I was more interested in the first definition, as it's
properties are more similar to those of recursive algorithms
traversing binary trees, for example.
</p>

<p>
In Oberon, it looks like this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-screen">PROCEDURE fib(n:INTEGER): INTEGER;
VAR result: INTEGER;
BEGIN
  IF n &lt; 2 THEN result := 1
  ELSE result := fib(n-2) + fib(n-1) END
RETURN result END fib;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
As a remark, in Oberon-07 the <code>RETURN</code> statement is a special
statement only applicable at the end of a function. This is to
explicitly express there are no premature exits from the function
procedure. While this sometimes demands the declaration of a local result
variable in program code, it actually can be removed by an
optimizing compiler.
</p>

<p>
The fibonacci function can be embedded into a module like this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-screen">MODULE Recursion;
IMPORT Out;

PROCEDURE fib(n:INTEGER): INTEGER;
(* implementation *)
END fib;

PROCEDURE Test*; (* Recursion.Test *)
VAR i: INTEGER;
BEGIN
  FOR i := 1 TO 35 DO
    Out.WriteInt(i, 4); Out.WriteString(<span style="color: #8b2252;">": "</span>);
    Out.WriteInt(fib(i), 4); Out.WriteLn
  END
END Test;

END Recursion.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
In an Oberon System, the <code>Test</code> procedure (declared as exported from the
module by the asterisk) could then be executed by just clicking on the text
<code>Recursion.Test</code> within the comment marks. Don't be disturbed too much
by the very pascalesque style of the Write statements (and also not by
the style of putting more than one statement into a single line..)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d5ad0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb8d5ad0">Tail call recursion with continuations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb8d5ad0">
<p>
In the next step, the simple recursive procedure is transformed into a
tail call recursion, involving a result variable taken through
the recursion, accumulating the intermediate result steps. As there
are two recursive calls, this is done by using continuations.
</p>

<p>
First, we define three classes (and a common base class) containing the data
of the different continuation steps and the respective constructor
procedures. 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-screen">TYPE
  Continuation = POINTER TO ContinuationDesc;
  ContinuationDesc = RECORD END;

  Ident = POINTER TO IdentDesc;
  IdentDesc = RECORD(ContinuationDesc) END;

  P1 = POINTER TO P1Desc;
  P1Desc = RECORD(ContinuationDesc)
    n: INTEGER;
    cont: Continuation
  END;

  P2 = POINTER TO P2Desc;
  P2Desc = RECORD(ContinuationDesc)
    res1: INTEGER;
    prev: P1
  END;

PROCEDURE ident(): Continuation;
VAR result: Ident;
BEGIN NEW(result)
RETURN result END ident;

PROCEDURE step1(n: INTEGER; cont: Continuation): Continuation;
VAR result: P1;
BEGIN NEW(result); result.n := n; result.cont := cont
RETURN result END step1;

PROCEDURE step2(res1: INTEGER; prev: P1): Continuation;
VAR result: P2;
BEGIN NEW(result); result.res1 := res1; result.prev := prev
RETURN result END step2;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The fibonacci function now needs a few embedded helper
functions for the continuations. This actually could be expressed much
more condensed if there were anonymous lambda functions and closures of
local variable environments in Oberon. On the other hand, this
explicit formulation of procedures in my opinion expresses more clearly the
different steps involved. Also note in Oberon the <code>CASE</code>
statement is actually a type dispatcher.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-screen">PROCEDURE fib(n:INTEGER; cont: Continuation): INTEGER;
VAR result: INTEGER;

  PROCEDURE dispatch(cont: Continuation; value: INTEGER): INTEGER;
  VAR result: INTEGER;

    PROCEDURE Step1(closure: P1; res1: INTEGER): INTEGER;
    BEGIN RETURN fib(closure.n-1, step2(res1, closure))
    END Step1;

    PROCEDURE Step2(closure: P2; res2: INTEGER): INTEGER;
    BEGIN RETURN dispatch(closure.prev.cont, closure.res1 + res2)
    END Step2;

  BEGIN
    CASE cont OF
      Ident: result := value |
      P1: result := Step1(cont, value) |
      P2: result := Step2(cont, value)
    END
  RETURN result END dispatch;

BEGIN
  IF n &lt; 2 THEN result := dispatch(cont, 1)
  ELSE result := fib(n-2, step1(n, cont)) END
RETURN result END fib;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
What this code says is
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>if n &lt; 2, don't return the result value of 1, but dispatch it
to the current continuation object,</li>
<li>else do a recursive call of fib with n-2, forwarding it's
result to a <code>P1</code> continuation object generated by the step1
procedure.</li>
</ol>

<p>
So far, now we have just one tail call recursion. Later on, when such
a <code>P1</code> continuation is dispatched, it will do the second recursive
call of fib, this time with n-1 and forwarding that call's result to a
<code>P2</code> continuation object, which also receives the result of the first
call. Again later on, when dispatching that <code>P2</code> object, the two intermediate
results forwarded from the previous calls with n-2 and n-1 are added
and the final result is dispatched to the stored initial continuation.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the initial call to fib in the Test procedure is changed to
<code>Out.WriteInt(fib(i, ident()), 4);</code>. This way, the continuation object
receiving the final result when dispatched will just return it.
</p>

<p>
As you see, this involves quite a few bits of glue code, some of which is
going away again in the next step. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1241312" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1241312">Iterative approach</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1241312">
<p>
Now, each tail call recursion is nothing else than a loop with the
parameter variable values replaced by the arguments of the recursion call.
We now do this transformation into a loop in two steps. First, if you
have a closer look, you see there actually is an inner (tail call)
recursion in the dispatch function.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-screen">PROCEDURE fib(n:INTEGER; cont: Continuation): INTEGER;
VAR result: INTEGER;

  PROCEDURE dispatch(cont: Continuation; result: INTEGER): INTEGER;
  VAR
    closure: Continuation;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">done</span>: BOOLEAN;
  BEGIN done := FALSE;
    REPEAT
      closure := cont;
      CASE closure OF
        Ident: done := TRUE |
        P1: result := fib(closure.n-1, step2(result, closure)); <span style="color: #a020f0;">done</span> := TRUE |
        P2: INC(result, closure.res1); cont := closure.prev.cont;
      END
    UNTIL done
  RETURN result END dispatch;

BEGIN
  IF n &lt; 2 THEN result := dispatch(cont, 1)
  ELSE result := fib(n-2, step1(n, cont)) END
RETURN result END fib;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now, the dispatch function contains a loop and the two helper
functions are gone. In case of dispatching a <code>P1</code> object, as before,
we return the result of the recursive fib call and leave the loop. In
case of the <code>Ident</code> object, the loop is also left and we just route
through the result passed in.
</p>

<p>
<code>P2</code> objects are dispatched now by adding their intermediate result to
our result variable, taking their continuation object as our next one
and then repeating, which is exactly what the recursive dispatch call
in the previous version did (if the Oberon compiler could do tail call
optimization).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgef3162a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgef3162a">Iterative approach, continued</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgef3162a">
<p>
Finally, we also transform the outer recursion into a loop, combining
it with the dispatcher loop into a multi-headed <code>WHILE</code>, which again is
a specialty of Oberon.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-screen">PROCEDURE fib(n:INTEGER; cont: Continuation): INTEGER;
VAR
  closure: Continuation;
  result: INTEGER;
BEGIN result := 1;
  WHILE n &gt;= 2 DO
    cont := step1(n, cont); DEC(n, 2)
  ELSIF ~(cont IS Ident) DO
    closure := cont;
    CASE closure OF
      P1: cont := step2(result, closure); n := closure.n-1; result := 1 |
      P2: INC(result, closure.res1); cont := closure.prev.cont;
    END
  END
RETURN result END fib;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
While this looks totally non-intuitive compared to the original simple
recursion, it shows how a recursion with more than one recursive
call can be implemented as a loop.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga97dcef" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga97dcef">Final thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga97dcef">
<p>
When thinking about this, you see the growing stack involved in the
original recursion actually being replaced by a growing structure of objects
dynamically allocated in memory. In the recursive case, the stack is
unfolded by leaving recursion levels, while in the iteration, the
garbage collector is involved, cleaning up abandoned objects.
</p>

<p>
When using the original Oberon system with cooperative multitasking,
you could now do further rewrites involving oberon tasks,
breaking down the loop into task steps to allow the garbage collector to
kick in between.
</p>

<p>
You could also replace the dynamically allocated objects by using a
static array of objects in form of an explicit stack. When doing this
you might find some interesting peculiarities, like the maximum array
size needed for this being n-1, which is obvious if you think about this
recursion a little bit ;-)
